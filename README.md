# C++ Project Starter (PowerShell)

A minimal PowerShell script that instantly sets up a clean C++ project folder with CMake support.

## 🧱 What It Does
- Creates folders: `src/`, `include/`, `build/`
- Adds a simple `main.cpp` that prints “Hello from <project name>”
- Generates a ready-to-run `CMakeLists.txt`

## ⚙️ Usage
Run the script from PowerShell:
```powershell
.\create_project.ps1 MyProject
